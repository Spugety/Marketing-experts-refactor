## üìù Notes
During this challenge I learned the importance of closing workspaces in Visual Studio Code, to ensure LiveServer pulls from the correct html file.
I also got lots of practice messing up commands in Git Bash.

I am left with some questions though, too. 
Why is the `<div>` tag still used, if it can so easily and so often be replaced with a semantic tag, which is compatible with accessibility requirements?

This code is copied from the starter code by Xandromus.
It is refactored to be more accessible by Trevor Dent.
